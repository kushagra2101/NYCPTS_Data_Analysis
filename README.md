# NYCPTS_Data_Analysis
The NYC public transportation system - Metro Transit Authority - dataset contains weekly logs for cumulative entries and exits by turnstile and by subway station during a provided timeframe. The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between data from the NYC Subway turnstiles and the city weather.
